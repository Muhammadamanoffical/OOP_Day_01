ðŸ“˜ Python OOP: Classes and Objects
This repository demonstrates the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python using simple class-based examples. 
The project focuses on how to define classes, create objects, use constructors, and invoke instance methods to simulate real-world behavior.
1. Basic Class Definition
Introduces a Computer class with:
Attributes (e.g., ram, processor, storage, etc.)
Methods (e.g., coding(), Designing(), browsing())
2. Dynamic Initialization with Constructors
This section demonstrates the use of the __init__() constructor to create dynamic object instances with unique attributes.


ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts Demonstrated
Class and object creation
Class vs instance variables
Object methods
Use of constructors (__init__)
Passing dynamic values to objects
Method invocation via both object and class
